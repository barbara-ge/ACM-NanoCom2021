Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 67.2 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.88 percent.
On average the neurons have 210.6271 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 683 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 170 micrometer.
There are 4955 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 176.871 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 2.5806.
The highest gap junction amount is 5 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 70.8513 micrometers.
2571 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 18.9924 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
