Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 69.796 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.9184 percent.
On average the neurons have 214.0073 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 723 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 162 micrometer.
There are 5076 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 182.4839 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 2.7742.
The highest gap junction amount is 5 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 70.363 micrometers.
2610 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 18.7446 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
