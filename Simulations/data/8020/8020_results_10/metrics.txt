Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 70.824 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 28.3296 percent.
On average the neurons have 212.5262 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 759 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 194 micrometer.
There are 5196 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 179.8871 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 2.8065.
The highest gap junction amount is 6 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 70.3548 micrometers.
2720 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 19.6064 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
