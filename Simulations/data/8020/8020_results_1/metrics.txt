Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 64.092 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 25.6368 percent.
On average the neurons have 214.3485 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 740 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 127 micrometer.
There are 4707 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 172.8548 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 2.4839.
The highest gap junction amount is 5 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 67.4786 micrometers.
2174 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 16.8645 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
