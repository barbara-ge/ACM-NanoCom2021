Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 66.588 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.6352 percent.
On average the neurons have 215.1376 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 788 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 215 micrometer.
There are 4796 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 180.3871 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 2.7419.
The highest gap junction amount is 5 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 72.6921 micrometers.
2031 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 15.3689 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
