Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 69.044 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.6176 percent.
On average the neurons have 211.9483 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 713 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 120 micrometer.
There are 5024 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 180.0161 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 2.3871.
The highest gap junction amount is 5 and the lowest 1.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 69.7032 micrometers.
2628 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 19.0587 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
