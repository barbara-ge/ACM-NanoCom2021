Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 69.492 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.7968 percent.
On average the neurons have 214.9403 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 713 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 190 micrometer.
There are 4985 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 184.9839 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 2.6129.
The highest gap junction amount is 6 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 67.2426 micrometers.
2576 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 18.341 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
