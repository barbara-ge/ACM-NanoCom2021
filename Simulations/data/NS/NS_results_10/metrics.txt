Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 70.684 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 28.2736 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.4469 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 676 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 195 micrometer.
There are 5195 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 128.4579 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.6168.
The highest gap junction amount is 8 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 70.7481 micrometers.
452 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 3.1838 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
