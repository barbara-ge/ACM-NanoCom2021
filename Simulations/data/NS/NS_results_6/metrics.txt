Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 67.14 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.856 percent.
On average the neurons have 214.4529 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 718 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 155 micrometer.
There are 4851 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 123.2804 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.6729.
The highest gap junction amount is 10 and the lowest 1.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 69.4279 micrometers.
364 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 2.6854 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
