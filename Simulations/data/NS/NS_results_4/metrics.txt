Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 65.892 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.3568 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.2162 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 792 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 158 micrometer.
There are 4812 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 122.5327 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.5421.
The highest gap junction amount is 9 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 68.8684 micrometers.
337 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 2.5059 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
