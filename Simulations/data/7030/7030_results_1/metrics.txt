Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 67.964 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.1856 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.016 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 779 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 179 micrometer.
There are 4914 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 123.0374 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.6916.
The highest gap junction amount is 9 and the lowest 1.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 69.859 micrometers.
306 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 2.2715 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
