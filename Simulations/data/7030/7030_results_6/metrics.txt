Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 67.96 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.184 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.201 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 773 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 170 micrometer.
There are 4889 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 116.4206 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 5.0841.
The highest gap junction amount is 10 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 70.2263 micrometers.
1238 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 9.0398 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
