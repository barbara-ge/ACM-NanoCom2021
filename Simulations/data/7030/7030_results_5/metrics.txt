Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 70.156 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 28.0624 percent.
On average the neurons have 212.5713 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 693 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 158 micrometer.
There are 5086 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 127.8879 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.6542.
The highest gap junction amount is 9 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 68.3164 micrometers.
476 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 3.3616 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
