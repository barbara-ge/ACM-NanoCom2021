Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 64.032 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 25.6128 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.3171 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 791 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 205 micrometer.
There are 4644 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 114.7383 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.6542.
The highest gap junction amount is 10 and the lowest 1.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 72.052 micrometers.
388 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 3.0636 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
