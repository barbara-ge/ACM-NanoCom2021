Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 66.216 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.4864 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.3275 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 739 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 108 micrometer.
There are 4819 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 120.7664 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.4486.
The highest gap junction amount is 8 and the lowest 1.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 69.186 micrometers.
424 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 3.177 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
