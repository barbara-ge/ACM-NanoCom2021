Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 69.012 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.6048 percent.
On average the neurons have 209.7653 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 727 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 168 micrometer.
There are 5117 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 124.1682 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.3551.
The highest gap junction amount is 9 and the lowest 1.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 68.8309 micrometers.
367 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 2.6881 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
