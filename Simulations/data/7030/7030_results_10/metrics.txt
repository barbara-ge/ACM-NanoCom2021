Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 65.24 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.096 percent.
On average the neurons have 211.9822 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 797 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 140 micrometer.
There are 4711 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 115.8505 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.6916.
The highest gap junction amount is 9 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 69.4439 micrometers.
576 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 4.4403 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
