Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 69.168 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.6672 percent.
On average the neurons have 211.9516 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 701 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 142 micrometer.
There are 5043 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 128.1869 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.8411.
The highest gap junction amount is 10 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 70.5329 micrometers.
280 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 2.0006 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
