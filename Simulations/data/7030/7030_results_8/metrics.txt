Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 67.568 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.0272 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.3713 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 699 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 128 micrometer.
There are 4938 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 122.1963 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 4.9346.
The highest gap junction amount is 8 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 69.9381 micrometers.
532 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 3.9098 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
