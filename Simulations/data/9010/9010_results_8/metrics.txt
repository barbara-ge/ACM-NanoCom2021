Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 68.304 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.3216 percent.
On average the neurons have 210.8388 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 748 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 186 micrometer.
There are 5010 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 229.5357 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 1.0714.
The highest gap junction amount is 3 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 72.2391 micrometers.
6969 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 52.023 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
