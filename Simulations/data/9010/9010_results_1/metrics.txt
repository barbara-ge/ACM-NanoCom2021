Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 67.656 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.0624 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.3255 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 697 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 108 micrometer.
There are 4911 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 238.5357 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 1.2143.
The highest gap junction amount is 3 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 68.6998 micrometers.
6811 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 50.4893 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
