Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 67.132 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.8528 percent.
On average the neurons have 214.8124 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 697 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 203 micrometer.
There are 4826 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 238.3214 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 1.4286.
The highest gap junction amount is 7 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 71.2411 micrometers.
6526 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 49.4431 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
