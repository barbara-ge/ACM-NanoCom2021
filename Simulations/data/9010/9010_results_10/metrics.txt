Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 69.22 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.688 percent.
On average the neurons have 214.2492 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 747 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 144 micrometer.
There are 5058 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 266.3929 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 0.78571.
The highest gap junction amount is 3 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 69.0573 micrometers.
6432 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 46.3034 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
