Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 72.8 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 29.12 percent.
On average the neurons have 210.9362 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 800 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 156 micrometer.
There are 5314 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 298.8929 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 1.1429.
The highest gap junction amount is 3 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 69.1489 micrometers.
6509 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 43.7492 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
