Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 66.568 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.6272 percent.
On average the neurons have 212.2017 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 682 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 159 micrometer.
There are 4873 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 198.75 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 1.2857.
The highest gap junction amount is 4 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 64.2957 micrometers.
7534 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 57.5158 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
