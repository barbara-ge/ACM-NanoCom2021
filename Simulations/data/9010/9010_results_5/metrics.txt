Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 69.8 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.92 percent.
On average the neurons have 213.8915 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 623 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 161 micrometer.
There are 5080 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 236.8214 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 1.1429.
The highest gap junction amount is 3 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 71.1397 micrometers.
7238 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 52.1883 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
