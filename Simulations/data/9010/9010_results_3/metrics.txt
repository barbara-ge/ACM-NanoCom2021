Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 69.256 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 27.7024 percent.
On average the neurons have 214.4759 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 756 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 148 micrometer.
There are 5064 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 263.3214 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 0.71429.
The highest gap junction amount is 2 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 75.5489 micrometers.
6314 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 46.1314 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
