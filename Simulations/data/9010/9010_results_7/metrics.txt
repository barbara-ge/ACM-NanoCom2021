Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 66.972 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.7888 percent.
On average the neurons have 212.652 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 895 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 236 micrometer.
There are 4863 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 258.0714 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 1.
The highest gap junction amount is 3 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 68.876 micrometers.
6355 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 46.7933 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
