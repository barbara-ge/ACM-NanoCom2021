Neuron Network

Maximum amount of NN connections available is 62250.
On average a neuron is connected to 67.388 other neurons.
This gives the network connectivity of 26.9552 percent.
On average the neurons have 214.7221 micrometer long connections.
The shortest connection was 11 micrometer long.
The longest connection was 719 micrometer long.
The most frequent length of connection was 120 micrometer.
There are 4915 two directional connections between neurons.

Astrocyte Network

On average an astrocyte is connected to 269.6429 nearby excitatory synapses.
Average gap junction connections between astrocytes is 1.
The highest gap junction amount is 2 and the lowest 0.
Average distance between connected astrocytes is 66.0645 micrometers.
5832 excitatory synapses were left without an astrocyte.
This results in 43.5809 percent of not astrocyte controlled excitatory synapses.
